Game starts on level 1. There are 5 rows of 11 enemies each. You start with 3 extra lives.

Level is displayed in upper left corner, current score to its right, number of lives remaining on the right.

Your goal is to shoot and kill as many enemy invaders as possible.

They will gradually descend down the screen and increase in speed while shooting down at you.

You can hide behind four barriers that are also being attacked by enemies.

Once you've killed all enemies in the level, you proceed to the next one and gain an extra life.

In each level the enemies start out moving faster.

Once you are defeated your score is displayed along with the 3 highest scores.

You move with either the left and right arrow keys or A and D keys. You shoot with the up arrow, W key, or spacebar.
